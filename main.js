//This is the object that you should use to "populate" the template
const gitHop = {
  name: "GitHop",
  imgSrc: "githop.png",
  description: "FooBar's Venom Ale",
};

//Step 1: Chose the <template>'s content

//Step 2: Make a "clone"

//Step 3: Change the content of the clone

//Step 4: Chose the new "parent" element
